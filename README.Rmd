## errors and solutions
1. Error: there is no packages called "bookdown" "rmarkdown" "dplyr" and so on. Sometimes, this kind of error just like this
"Error in loadNamespace(name) : �����ڽ�'RSQLite'������ֵĳ̼���
Calls: local ... loadNamespace -> withRestarts -> withOneRestart -> doWithOneRestart". 

   Solution: Install these packages when above error occured. Especially, when i install package emo, it reminds me emo is not available for my version, R 3.6.3. So i have to install this packages by using github. The code i use is:
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install github("Hadley/emo")
    ```

2. Error: Quitting from lines 223-235 (Introduction.Rmd).Error in cat(paste0(contributors$desc, collapse = ", ")).
   
   Solution: Open introduction.rmd and add encoding="UTF-8" in line 224. 


3. Error: There are some strange symbol, but the main meaning is it can't open 'http://r4ds.had.co.nz'.
   
   Solution: Change the URL to https://r4ds.had.co.nz.


4. Error: In system(cmd): "make" not found.
   
   Solution: Download software Rtools. Then, change add the Rtools's file-bin path in the systerm setting.But you need to download it at default path. When i change the path, it still occured some error.

5. Error: In system2(..., stdout = if (use_file_stdout()) f1 else FALSE, stderr = f2) : '"xelatex"' not found.

   Solution: Read the hint carefully and open that URL. Althougt i install latex by following URL, i still have the same problem. Finally i use MiKTex to fix it. And i made the same thing just like Rtools, add the miktex-console's path in the enviroment variable. Besides, i have to set "always install missing packages on-the-fly" and update to avoid another problem.
   
6. Error: Package fontspec Error: The font "Inconsolata" cannot be found; Package fontspec Error: The font "Andale Mono" cannot be found.
   
   Solution: Download and install the fonts from the website, because they are not packages from R.

## Thanks
